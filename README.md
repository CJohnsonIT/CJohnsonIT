<h1>Hi there 👋</h1>


My name is Charles, and I have a passion for all things IT.

I enjoy building and experimenting with projects to further my understanding, and to share what I create along the way. 


<h2>🔭 Current Project</h2>
I'm currently working on partioning one of the SSDs in my personal PC to set up a dual boot environment with Linux. My goal is to get a better understanding with Linux system administration, experiement with different distros, and strengthen my comfort with the command line and system config.

<h2>📂 Projects / Labs</h2>

<b>Windows Server 2022 Virtual Lab</b>
 
  - Installed and configured VirtualBox with Windows Server 2022 & Windows 10/11 client machines in a test domain. 
  - Added Windows 10 client machines to the domain and created/modified Active Directory user accounts.
  - Configured server settings, TCP/IP, Remote Desktop, and Group Policy Objects (GPOs). 
  - Set up Azure AD Connect for hybrid Azure AD join and seamless SSO using password hash sync.
